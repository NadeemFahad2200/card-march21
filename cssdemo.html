        As we have already seen that, all of the React components have a render
        function. The render function specifies the HTML output of a React
        component. JSX(JavaScript Extension), is a React extension which allows
        writing JavaScript code that looks like HTML. In other words, JSX is an
        HTML-like syntax used by React that extends ECMAScript so that HTML-like
        syntax can co-exist with JavaScript/React code. The syntax is used by
        preprocessors (i.e., transpilers like babel) to transform HTML-like
        syntax into standard JavaScript objects that a JavaScript engine will
        parse.

        ReactJS is much easier to learn and use. It comes with a good supply of
        documentation, tutorials, and training resources. Any developer who
        comes from a JavaScript background can easily understand and start
        creating web apps using React in a few days. It is the V(view part) in
        the MVC (Model-View-Controller) model, and referred to as ?one of the
        JavaScript frameworks.? It is not fully featured but has the advantage
        of open-source JavaScript User Interface(UI) library, which helps to
        execute the task in a better manner.
