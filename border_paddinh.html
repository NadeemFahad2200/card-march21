      The main objective of ReactJS is to develop User Interfaces (UI) that
      improves the speed of the apps. It uses virtual DOM (JavaScript object),
      which improves the performance of the app. The JavaScript virtual DOM is
      faster than the regular DOM. We can use ReactJS on the client and
      server-side as well as with other frameworks. It uses component and data
      patterns that improve readability and helps to maintain larger apps.
